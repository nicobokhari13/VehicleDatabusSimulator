# Vehicle Databus Simulator 

This project allows the user to send specific events to a Vehicle, and witness how the Vehicle reacts to the specific event. 
The Vehicle implements the Data Bus design pattern in order to facilitate complex component communication such that the Vehicle's components can respond to the event inputted by the user.

## Purpose

This software was created as a demo to a research project for the course CIS476:Software Architecture and Design Patterns offered at University of Michigan - Dearborn. I completed this course as a requirement for my Software Engineering degree. 

## Overview

For this project, I... 
* researched the Data Bus Design Pattern
* created a presentation showcasing my findings
* developed this software project to apply the Data Bus Pattern
* produce and edit a video presenting my research and demoing this project
